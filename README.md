# Bamazon
MySQL &amp; Node.js

This application implements an Amazon-like storefront. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 

# MySQL Database Setup
In order to run this application, you should have the MySQL database already set up on your machine. 
If you don't, visit the MySQL installation page to install the version you need for your operating system.

# Customer Interface
The customer interface allows the user to view the current inventory of store items: 
item IDs, descriptions, department in which the item is located and price. The user is then able to purchase one of the existing items by entering the item ID and the desired quantity. 
If the selected quantity is currently in stock, the user's order is fulfilled, displaying the total purchase price and updating the store database. If the desired quantity is not available, the user is prompted to modify their order.
